2,"Do you want to transition into Data Science and Analytics? Thomas Festus has some tips for you.

It is entirely possible to transition into Data Science and Analytics from any field but you need to put in the work.

Whiles learning and looking for opportunities for that transition, these are some of the few things you can do to keep your skills fresh and set yourself up for success.

👉Build a strong online presence on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a powerful platform that can help you to build a strong brand and unlock opportunities to realize your career goals.

To cut through the noise, make sure your profile is up to date and you are visible.

👉Share your work and build your portfolio.

It's not enough to have an online presence. You need to constantly share your work and how you are growing in the field.

Sharing your work makes you visible, helps you build social proof, and makes people develop trust in your skills.
People have recommended me for roles and training opportunities not because they have worked with me before but because they have seen my work.

👉Join or build a community to grow your skills.

To keep your skills up to date and shorten your learning curve, join a tech community. If one doesn't exist, you can create one to share and grow your skills.


👉Develop your transferable skills.

To begin a career in data analytics, you need to develop soft skills such as problem-solving, attention to detail, communication, team working, and analytical skills.

You can easily develop these skills in different areas of your career.

👉Work on projects. In the quest to make a transition, you may be tempted to focus on learning a whole lot of stuff to make sure you don't miss out on any opportunity.

At some point, you need to stop learning and work on projects. Working on projects will help to test your skills and measure your progress.

Participate in Data hackathons and Data challenges to build your skills.

You can join our monthly Data challenge at FestMan™ Learning Hub.

These are some of the few things that helped me along the way. I believe they can help you as well.

Cheers 🥂

6,"Top 5 tips for writing an amazing Resume in 2022

It is a new year and most Job seekers will be looking forward to landing their dream jobs. 

In this post, we share 5 tips you need to incorporate on your resume for success this year.

1. Customize your resume for every role you apply for. Avoid generic Resume. Make sure to tailor your resume for the role you are applying for. Do not use the same resume to apply for different roles.

2. Use Action words to highlight accomplishments. Do not just list your duties or responsibilities in your professional experience section. Use action words to highlight your achievements and accomplishments.

3. Quantify your achievements. Humans are moved by numbers. Quantify your achievements as much as possible.  For example, Increased Sales by implementing social media campaigns. This can be written as "" Increased sales by 20% by implementing...""

4. Avoid clichés: To write a winning resume, avoid clichés such as result-driven, team player, etc. Replace any overused clichés with powerful statements that provide evidence of your skills and competencies.

5. Highlight your key skills, values, and transferable skills and align them with the requirements of the role. You may have a lot of skills and experiences but you need to include the ones that are relevant to the role.

We will be running a live instructor-led session on Power Query for Microsoft Excel users.

Would you be able to join us live and take your Excel skills to the next level?

Given the rapid shifts in skill requirements and the number of entirely new tasks and roles that are emerging, professionals who will learn how to automate their mundane and repetitive complex tasks will create a significant opportunity to learn and take on more strategic roles at the work place.

Most professionals use Microsoft Excel for analysis and reporting.
Learning how to automate your mundane and repetitive tasks and reporting with Power Query will open the possibility to take on more strategic roles within your company.

Power Query is the most important data analysis tool since PivotTables. With Power Query, you'll be able to clean, reshape, and combine your data with ease, no matter where it comes from.

Do you use these Excel functions repeatedly for reporting: VLOOKUP, INDEX AND MATCH, IFS, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, CONCATENATE, UPPER, LOWER, DATE, TEXT, TRANSPOSE, TEXTJOIN, SUBSTITUTE, FIND and REPLACE?

In this course, you will learn how to replace these functions with Power Query and automate your reports without code. You will perform these calculations once and deploy them multiple times to save time for high-value tasks.

We call this course "" Excel without functions""😍.

94,"As our Data Hackers are getting their hands dirty with our Data Challenge, these are the few visualization principles we will share with them.

👉Context is king
The KPIs on your dashboard mean little by themselves. The meaning or value can only be gleaned by using them in the context of other information or metrics. For example, YTD Sales of 11k or Return on sales of 20% without any context mean little. Is this number good or bad? 


👉Embrace clarity and reduce clutter
Your dashboard needs to convey your story and insights as clearly, quickly and cohesively as possible. In the selection of font types, color, text orientation and backgrounds, always use the options that make your words as legible as possible.  Avoid excessive decoration.

👉Be consistent
Inconsistency can make your visualization confusing and hard to interpret and this distract your users from your core message. Keep your design elements such as color, fonts and font sizes and line weight uniform across your dashboard.

👉Use colors sparingly
The selection of your colors should be done deliberately without losing sight of how people perceive color and the significant of color differences. Always choose the right colors to tell your stories. 

👉Finally, don’t forget to pick the right visuals for your dashboard.

122,"🤔Want to create effective and engaging data visualizations?

For anyone developing a dashboard or any visual artifact, following these short but important techniques will help you produce good visuals.

1. Start with a question

Your dashboard or visuals should have a purpose. To identify the purpose, you need to ask these questions; who are my audience?, what questions do they have?, what's insights do I want to share with them?.

2. Choose the right chart type

Once you have a purpose for your visualization and the insights you want to share, it's time to think about how to visualize your insights using appropriate charts. Your choice of visuals can break your story.

3. Tell your story quickly using clear colors

Your choice of colors is very important. Colors convey so much without using words. Maintain consistent colors and use them sparingly. 


4. Context is key.

Context helps your audience decipher the story at first glance. The meaning of values or KPIs can only be gleaned when compared to a benchmark or other KPIs.

5 Embrace brevity and avoid clutter.

You need to be selective about what to include in your dashboard based on the purpose.


We believe these tips will help you produce good visuals that invoke actions.
